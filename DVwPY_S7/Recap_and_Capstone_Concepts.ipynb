    "### Primary Skill Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The skillsets we have been most developing in the foreground encompass:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter -- how we develop and publish our content\n",
    "* numpy -- the number crunching king of vectorized operations\n",
    "* matplotlib -- [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) imitates Matlab's way of doing things\n",
    "* pandas -- sophisticated DataFrames, isomorphic to spreadsheets*\n",
    "* seaborn -- augmented data visualization, beyond anything up to now\n",
    "* plotly -- our final sessions dive into this visualization alternative\n",
    "* python -- Python itself has more power, as one learns to tap it\n",
    "* Regexes -- pattern matching, a standalone mini-language incorporated by Python\n",
    "* LaTeX -- we use it to share math typography in a Jupyter Notebook context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Skill Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondarily, we have been reviewing the relevance of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "* [git bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) \n",
    "* Github\n",
    "* [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/)\n",
    "* [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-tex)\n",
    "* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)\n",
    "* Anaconda\n",
    "* conda\n",
    "* pip\n",
    "* PiPy\n",

    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the open source revolution, many enterprises have gravitated to a base layer of communally shared products and projects, such as Python and SQL Alchemy, on top of which a proprietary non-public layer is added.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the non-public value added is not only source code, but also data.  Even with a communally shared ecosystem, there's still plenty of room for private enterprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal calls it \"InnerSource\":  using open source tools and workflows in a proprietary environment.  This is how many and probably most internet enterprises are constituted: using a combination of open and closed tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these developments, those of us wishing to join these enterprises have an opportunity to learn some of their tools (the open source ones) without investing in expensive license agreements or taking on the overhead of private ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have been learning about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [sources of data sets](DataSources.ipynb) and how to use them\n",
    "* sources of leaning materials and how to use them\n",
    "* ways of running our Notebooks in the cloud\n",
    "  - on Google Colab\n",
    "  - in a Dash / Plotly account\n",
    "  - on Kaggle\n",
    "  - with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)\n",
    "* the continuing relevance of IDEs\n",
    "  - Spyder\n",
    "  - IDLE\n",
    "  - PyCharm\n",
    "  - vscode\n",
    "* [the Capstone Project](https://github.com/4dsolutions/clarusway_data_analysis/blob/main/DVwPY_S7/CapStone_Example_Bike_Sharing.ipynb) genre (one of today's topics)"
