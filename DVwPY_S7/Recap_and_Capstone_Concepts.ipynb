    "\n",
    "Since the open source revolution, many enterprises have gravitated to a base layer of communally shared products and projects, such as Python and SQL Alchemy, on top of which a proprietary non-public layer is added.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the non-public value added is not only source code, but also data.  Even with a communally shared ecosystem, there's still plenty of room for private enterprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal calls it \"InnerSource\":  using open source tools and workflows in a proprietary environment.  This is how many and probably most internet enterprises are constituted: using a combination of open and closed tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these developments, those of us wishing to join these enterprises have an opportunity to learn some of their tools (the open source ones) without investing in expensive license agreements or taking on the overhead of private ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have been learning about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [sources of data sets](DataSources.ipynb) and how to use them\n",
    "* sources of leaning materials and how to use them\n",
    "* ways of running our Notebooks in the cloud\n",
    "  - on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "  - in a [Dash / Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/) account\n",
    "  - on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "  - with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)\n",
    "* the continuing relevance of IDEs\n",
