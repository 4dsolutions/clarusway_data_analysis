We imagine the data is a black box at first, and over time we learn to get a sense of it.  Even though we share the details of visualizations in Part 2 (this part), they apply throughout Part 1 i.e. you may start using the power of visualizations right away in EDA.\n",

A mental model may be enough, if the data fits some expected and understood pattern (\"retail sales\"), but we thrive on computational algorithms, and this is where ML comes in."

    "Throughout the subject of Statistics, a core aim has been prediction.  Since the dawn of history, we have had a need to divine the future, yet encounter limits on predictability.  \n",

    "\n",
    "These may sound like obvious truths, however in getting clear on such topics, we learn methods of computation.  We don't stop with some hazy notion of \"average\"; we break it out into mean, medium and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope intelligently anticipate (more than wildly or blindly guess), based on the many models we have developed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By model, we could mean a simulation.  Does our simulation run as a computer program?  Not necessarily.  People were simulating complex systems long before they had invented silicon chip computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also mean, my \"model\", some actual Python object developed for us by one of the model makers (KM, SVM...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are the model makers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model makers are well-known and/or still experimental algorithms.  We categorize them in various ways, such as into supervised and unsupervised. A good example of a working model would be a recommendation engine attached to a website.  \"Based on your choice of books so far, a next one of interest might be...\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "A model need not be mysterious and opaque.  A simple line through a bunch of dots well summarizes many of them.  However some models attain their high powers of prediction at the expense of being able to give us a set of rules.\n",

The feedback of getting it wrong or right is used to \"weight\" the \"neurons\" through a process known as \"gradient descent\" (uses calculus, partial derivatives, finds a downward path for an error function).\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about how you yourself learn from experience?  Having a strong sense of a right answer or how you want things to go, is motivational.  Machine Learning sets up a similar feedback loop in the algebra, especially in a supervised setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question before us is one of reliability.  Does our model do the job?  Is a newer model an improvement?\n",
    "\n",

    "The process is akin to shuffling cards as the same total data may be divvyed into testing and training in multiple ways, allowing for more averaging and perhaps fine tuning.  We looked at similar bootstrapping ideas in connection with the Confidance Interval (Seaborn barplot etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "What's left out of the above description is the whole matter of selecting the appropriate ML engine (model maker), with fine tuned hyperparameters. \n",
