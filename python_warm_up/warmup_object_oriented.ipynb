    "You may have heard that Python is object oriented (which is true), and wondered what that meant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly Python isn't the only object oriented language.  Smalltalk was among the first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new grammar, based on the metaphor of types (classes) and instances, was considered a breakthrough in its day, and many languages learned from Smalltalk. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also have non-OO languages, such as those branding themselves as \"functional programming languages\". The grandfather FP language is LISP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is flexible enough to allow an FP like style, meaning you might use it as a stepping stone to [a more purely functional one](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/functional-programming-languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "The OO way of thinking is meant to match your ordinary understanding of nouns and verbs.  Nouns are things, what we call objects, and verbs are the things the nouns do, their methods and abilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Things also have properties, or attributes, such as color and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "But what a thing might be expected to do, depends on its type.  That's how it works in ordinary language.  Depending on the type of something, we have different expectations for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Animal type thing is expected to eat, sleep, have a size and color.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Car type thing is expected to start, brake, turn, have passengers...\n",
    "\n",
    "A file type thing is expected to open and close, and be read, possibly added to or overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Deck (as in deck of cards) is expected to shuffle, and deal a hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of possible types is endless.  Some types come with the language (list, str, dict etc.), whereas the language itself is designed to encourage the programmer create new types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "The Car or Animal type is supposed to be generic, defining the verbs and properties that all examples of a Car or Animal would share.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Car or Animal objects would be called instances.  From the same blueprint or template, one may instantiate any number of unique and distinct cars and/or animals in memory.  They all share the same code, but each occupies its own place in memory, as something unique."
