    "This Jupyter Notebook lives inside a Github repository. When you open it on Github, the Github server turns a JSON file with extension .ipynb, into an HTML file that renders inside your browser.

    "The Notebook idea has a long history in the technical literature. Donald Knuth, the giant in computer science, envisioned a kind of \"literate programming\" wherein human and computer languages would mix seamlessly in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks originally stem from the [I-Python Notebook Project](https://ipython.org). I-Python was a broadly based open source project designed to enhance the Pythonista's interactive experience, especially with a better more capable REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook runs as a client in the web browser, yet is connected to a kernel on the server that knows how to process a computer language such as Python. Because of the web browser context, JavaScript, an in-browser language, is also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the I-Python Notebook was mature, the Jupyter Project refactored it so that other languages besides Python could play the role of kernel language."

    "## Installing Jupyter Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be encouraged to get enough free open source software installed on your local host to run [JupyterLabs](https://jupyter.org) with Notebooks inside them. This will make you independent of the cloud. You will be able to work without an internet connection. Python will be running on your machine, not on Google's, as it will be when using Colab.  It's not either / or.  You will be encouraged to switch back and forth between local and cloud workspace environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run JupyterLab you have two basic routes: \n",
    "\n",
    "* download Python from [Python.org](https://python.org) and then use pip install to download additional packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org), the Python Index. In the most sophisticated setups, you would install to a virtual environment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) of Python, which comes pre-equipped with all the packages you'll need\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend the second option because it's a lot easier and the Anaconda distribution is well-established as an industry standard. The first option might pertain if you are already comfortable with a pre-existing installation that you have been using productively, and you just want to enhance what you have, versus starting with a whole new distribution."
