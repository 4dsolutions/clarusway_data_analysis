    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Per our session three lecture and lab, and Sam's intro, our approach to Python is colored (as in flavored) by the discipline of data science. The main business of data science, and statistics at its core, featuring ideas about randomness, expectations, likelihood, probability, is \"predicting the future\" not by superstitious means, but by squeezing as much information about the past as feasible, in terms of patterns, and extrapolating these patterns. You might be thinking about climate change and how the ice ages come and go. Do we expect a next ice age? When? Data scientists want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the context of learning data science, the data we explore might not have much bearing on what you will handle on the job. Rather than try to predict your specific needs, we use data that other students and teachers are using as well, and in that way benefit from a large and growing secondary literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at one of those datasets now...\n"

For example, the tips DataFrame data is all about some smoke-filled restaurant, sometimes busy, sometimes not.

This will make you independent of the cloud. You will be able to work without an internet connection. Python will be running on your machine, not on Google's, as it will be when using Colab.  It's not either / or.  You will be encouraged to switch back and forth between local and cloud workspace environments.\n",

    "\n",
    "* download Python from [Python.org](https://python.org) and then use pip install to download additional packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org), the Python Index. In the most sophisticated setups, you would install to a virtual environment.\n",

    "* download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) of Python, which comes pre-equipped with all the packages you'll need\n",
    "\n",

The first option might pertain if you are already comfortable with a pre-existing installation that you have been using productively, and you just want to enhance what you have, versus starting with a whole new distribution."
